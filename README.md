# my-software-portfolio
I plan to build my software engineer portfolio website using this repo. 

I also want to use this repository to demonstrate my knowledge of Agile/Kanban and Scrum methodologies. So I will use this file to document my though process.

Let's write some of the requirements needed for this project: 

1. I want to have a nice project structrue that's easy to maintain
2. I want my page to have an infinite scroll 
2. I want to have a landing page with an interesting design 
3. I want to have an about me section that is easy to read and understand that shows who i am
4. I want a contact me page that makes it easy for people to reach me
5. I want a project section that displays the projects I've worked on as well as projects I'm currently working in
5. I want to deploy my website so that people can access it from anywhere. 


After this requirements I'll create some issues of my repo and add the to my project board on git.
